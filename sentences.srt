1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,320
Even if they want to cut down, even if they know
it's killing them, they find they can't stop.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:18,920
My name is Chris Van Tulleken
and I'm an NHS doctor, I'm a scientist, and I'm part of a growing
group of doctors and academics who are
increasingly worried about the effect that the global food system is having on all of us.

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,879
When it comes to obesity, the way that we've understood the problem is it's a failure
of willpower.

4
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:26,280
People are just making bad choices.

5
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,199
They're somewhat lazy.

6
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,440
It's basically their fault.

7
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,640
This is American
government data for men and women
of all different ages.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,880
The different lines
are different ages for obesity.

9
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:43,439
What you see is between 1960 and 1975, there's a fairly steady percentage of obesity in the population.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,799
But in the mid 1970s,
obesity starts going up in all of the groups simultaneously.

11
00:00:52,159 --> 00:01:00,640
Now, if you're saying willpower is responsible,
what you're proposing is that all of these groups of people simultaneously lost moral responsibility.

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,799
And that's not plausible.

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,799
Something else happened to our food in the mid 1970s to make it irresistible to people.

14
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,519
My name is John Ruff, and I've spent 40 years in the food industry across seven different countries.

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,879
Companies spend a lot of time
optimising all aspects of their product.

16
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,359
The
flavour, the taste, the texture.

17
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:27,159
People want their product to be
as good, if not better than the competitor, so it will sell more.

18
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,040
We use trained sensory panels to give
us ratings.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,200
Is it squishy?

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,719
Is it hard?

21
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,239
Is it soft?

22
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,159
Is it crunchy?

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,519
That's very much how the food
industry operates.

24
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:44,359
One thing many people don’t realise is
that factory processing changes the textural properties of food.

25
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,000
An interesting fact
about soft food is you're not chewing
it as much.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,640
That actually short circuits the normal satiety mechanisms
that you would have if you were actually chewing food properly.

27
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,359
So, you're bypassing a normal mechanism
that tells you you're full.

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:19,879
Once we worked out that playing around with the
texture of food, making it softer, tricks that normal satiety of fullness mechanism, clearly there's an opportunity
there for some kind of scurrilous behaviour in making food softer, so that people will eat more and therefore you sell
more of your product.

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,039
So much of the packaged food
that we eat is incredibly soft.

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,719
My kids love these.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,039
You don't typically
think of this as being a soft food because it's a bit crunchy.

32
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:46,120
But actually after that
initial crunch, you can just crush it
with your tongue, right?

33
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,599
It's got no resistance
at all.

34
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,080
But in terms of the
calories per gram, it's got way more calories than
even a very fatty burger.

35
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,560
So, the softness and the energy density mean that you consume it incredibly quickly.

36
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,479
And there's a food
industry term for these very light, puffy foods that melt in the mouth.

37
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,599
It's called vanishing
caloric density.

38
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,319
Gone.

39
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,599
The thing that makes us eat
a lot isn't just what we do to the food.

40
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:28,439
It's also about logos, marketing, branding, the box the
food comes in.

41
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,800
Eating is a multi-sensory experience.

42
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,479
There's the look of the food.

43
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,400
There's the smell of the food.

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,960
There's the feeling of the food on your fingers.

45
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,240
Even the sound of
food matters.

46
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,800
When you open a fizzy soda, you've got two noises.

47
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,960
You've got the click and the tear.

48
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,800
Sound engineers and manufacturers work really hard to get that sound just right.

49
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,719
And that’s sonic branding.

50
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,199
Many companies have asked me to work on sonic
branding for them.

51
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,546
And I think I can mention
when I was working with Kellogg, they
said, “Ooh, what’s sonic branding?

52
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:27,893
” And I said, “You
invented this.

53
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:33,240
” Most people will remember
as children the experience of lifting a bowl to their ear.

54
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,680
And what are they
listening for?

55
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,399
Snap, crackle and pop.

56
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,319
That's sonic branding at its best, and that's the original.

57
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:49,279
There's a lot of competition
out there, and food companies
make their money by the amount of products
we consume from them.

58
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:56,439
So, there's a stomach share that they're fighting for and there are hours in the day in between breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

59
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,399
What happens between
those hours?

60
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,839
They want us to snack.

61
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,199
You wake up and this
is what you have.

62
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,399
Snack number one.

63
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,800
Breakfast shake, ultra-processed.

64
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,920
This is heavily marketed for you to
have on the go.

65
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Do not sit down.

66
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,560
Do not take time to crunch through something.

67
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,040
Snack number two of the day.

68
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,800
It's empty calories, energy dense, nutrient poor.

69
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,920
Midday, you're starting to get
a little bit peckish, and what do you have?

70
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,199
Veggie straws.

71
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,800
This is a good example of a health claim snacking product.

72
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,399
Whereas before we would
have had food.

73
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,680
Actual food.

74
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,519
Now we are marketed
into believing that this is actually a
healthy replacement.

75
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,879
Some snacking products
have now been made to be linked with being physically active.

76
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:53,439
So, after the gym
I have a high protein, low sugar bar.

77
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,560
Instead of having a healthier option.

78
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:07,519
You finish having dinner and you have these snacks that are sold to you as more to share, where in fact you can
just finish them, watching the TV by yourself.

79
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,120
I do like them.

80
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,360
I cannot stop eating them.

81
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,920
And I literally can't.

82
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,360
Oh God.

83
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,759
I think one of the biggest problems with this kind of food is that so many of us struggle to stop eating it.

84
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,360
Hi everyone.

85
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:34,480
I'm so thrilled to be here
today to speak with you on my research that looks at parallels between addictive substances
and ultra-processed food.

86
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:42,199
When we look at the sorts
of foods that trigger those key diagnostic indicators of addiction, it's really clear
what it's not.

87
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:49,800
It's not minimally processed foods like fruit or vegetables or beans or lean meats like
chicken breast.

88
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,759
It's really processed foods.

89
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,839
It's chocolate.

90
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,920
It's ice cream.

91
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,519
It's pizza.

92
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,600
It's foods that don't
exist in nature.

93
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:16,360
The potency and the reward power of these ultra-processed foods can trigger an
addictive response that leads them
to consume these in such a compulsive way, that even if they want
to cut down, even if they know
it's killing them, they find they can't stop.

94
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Imagine you're trying to cut down on
ultra-processed food or avoid it altogether.

95
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:32,120
For a start, it might be the only food
you can afford, and that is true
for millions of people, but it's everywhere.

96
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,279
And it's engineered
and then marketed by some of the smartest people on Earth to be irresistible.

97
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:50,160
So, if someone is watching this and they are struggling
with their weight, with diet-related disease, I just want to reach out
and grab them and go, “This is not your fault.

98
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,279
It is not you.

99
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,779
It is the food.

100
00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:00,279
” [Narration]
The Food and Drink Federation declined
our request for an interview
but provided this statement.

101
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:08,079
“Food and drink manufacturers take
the issue of obesity and poor diets very seriously,
and we know we have a key role to play in helping
people to eat balanced diets.

102
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,959
Our members continue to invest hundreds
of millions of pounds in creating healthier products
for shoppers.

103
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:19,000
As a result, UK shopping baskets now contain significantly less salt, sugar and calories
than they did a decade ago.

104
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,720
Companies are also working
to raise the fibre, fruit and vegetable content of their products.

105
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,600
It's of course up
to government if they want to introduce
new taxes or warning labels.

106
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,600
However, taxes will push up the cost of food
and could disincentivise ongoing investment
in healthier products.

107
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,759
We think there are more
effective ways to encourage positive dietary change.

108
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:47,720
On labelling, we believe the UK's traffic light system is a more positive way of nudging
consumers towards healthier choices
than warning labels, where global evidence suggests the longer
term impact is limited.

109
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:55,320
However, we would support
a labelling review, including to test whether
consistent positive labelling on all healthier products would help consumers.

110
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:07,759
The government's
Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition has said there's insufficient scientific evidence on the concept of ‘ultra-processed foods’ for it to be used for
dietary guidance or policy making, and that
further research is needed.

111
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:11,220
If research comes to light, that processing is a cause
for concern, the food industry will
act quickly to change their ingredients
or processes.

112
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,680
”
