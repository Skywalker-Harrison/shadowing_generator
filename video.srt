1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
Even if they want to cut down,

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,080
even if they know
it's killing them,

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,320
they find they can't stop.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:05,840
My name is

5
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,440
Chris Van Tulleken
and I'm an NHS doctor,

6
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,440
I'm a scientist,

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,840
and I'm part of a growing
group of doctors

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,200
and academics who are
increasingly worried

9
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,480
about the effect

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,920
that the global food system

11
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,920
is having on all of us.

12
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,000
When it comes to obesity,

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,240
the way that we've understood

14
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,880
the problem is it's a failure
of willpower.

15
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,080
People are just making

16
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,280
bad choices.

17
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,200
They're somewhat lazy.

18
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,440
It's basically their fault.

19
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,960
This is American
government data

20
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,640
for men and women
of all different ages.

21
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,880
The different lines
are different ages

22
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,880
for obesity.

23
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,080
What you see is

24
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,720
between 1960 and 1975,

25
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,440
there's a fairly steady

26
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,480
percentage of obesity

27
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,440
in the population.

28
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,960
But in the mid 1970s,
obesity starts

29
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,360
going up in all of the

30
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,800
groups simultaneously.

31
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,840
Now, if you're saying

32
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,440
willpower is responsible,
what you're proposing

33
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,280
is that all of these groups

34
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,240
of people simultaneously

35
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,640
lost moral responsibility.

36
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,800
And that's not plausible.

37
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,120
Something else happened

38
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,280
to our food in the mid 1970s

39
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,000
to make it irresistible

40
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,800
to people.

41
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,240
My name is John Ruff,

42
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,360
and I've spent

43
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,000
40 years in the food industry

44
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,520
across seven different countries.

45
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,960
Companies spend a lot of time
optimising all aspects

46
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
of their product. The
flavour, the taste,

47
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,360
the texture.

48
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,880
People want

49
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,240
their product to be
as good, if not

50
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,800
better than the competitor,

51
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,160
so it will sell more.

52
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,200
We use trained sensory

53
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,040
panels to give 
us ratings.

54
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,200
Is it squishy?

55
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,240
Is it hard? Is it soft?

56
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,160
Is it crunchy?

57
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,560
That's very much

58
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,520
how the food
industry operates.

59
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,480
One thing

60
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,160
many people don’t realise is
that factory processing

61
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,000
changes the textural properties

62
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,360
of food.

63
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,000
An interesting fact
about soft food

64
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
is you're not chewing
it as much.

65
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,920
That actually

66
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,320
short circuits the normal

67
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,480
satiety mechanisms
that you would have

68
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,760
if you were actually chewing

69
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,640
food properly.

70
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
So, you're bypassing

71
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,360
a normal mechanism
that tells you you're full.

72
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,160
Once we worked out that

73
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,000
playing around with the
texture of food,

74
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,480
making it softer,

75
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,560
tricks that normal satiety

76
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,400
of fullness mechanism, clearly

77
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,440
there's an opportunity
there for some kind of

78
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,720
scurrilous behaviour

79
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,520
in making food softer,

80
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,200
so that people will eat more

81
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,880
and therefore you sell
more of your product.

82
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,800
So much of the packaged food
that we eat

83
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,040
is incredibly soft.

84
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,720
My kids love these.

85
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,720
You don't typically
think of this

86
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,480
as being a soft food

87
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,040
because it's a bit crunchy.

88
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,840
But actually after that
initial crunch,

89
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,120
you can just crush it
with your tongue, right?

90
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,600
It's got no resistance
at all.

91
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,800
But in terms of the
calories per gram,

92
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,080
it's got way more calories than
even a very fatty burger.

93
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,520
So, the softness

94
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,000
and the energy density

95
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,080
mean that you consume it

96
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,560
incredibly quickly.

97
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,280
And there's a food
industry term

98
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,400
for these

99
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,320
very light,

100
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,520
puffy foods that

101
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,480
melt in the mouth.

102
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,600
It's called vanishing
caloric density.

103
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,320
Gone.

104
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,520
The thing

105
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,960
that makes us eat
a lot isn't just what

106
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,600
we do to the food.

107
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,960
It's also about

108
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,560
logos, marketing,

109
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,440
branding, the box the
food comes in.

110
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,840
Eating is a

111
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,800
multi-sensory experience.

112
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,480
There's the look of the food.

113
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,400
There's the smell of the food.

114
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,760
There's the feeling of the food

115
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,960
on your fingers.

116
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,240
Even the sound of
food matters.

117
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,000
When you open a fizzy

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,800
soda, you've got two noises.

119
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,760
You've got the click

120
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,960
and the tear.

121
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,600
Sound engineers and manufacturers

122
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,200
work really hard to get

123
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,800
that sound just right.

124
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,720
And that’s sonic branding.

125
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,200
Many companies have asked me

126
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
to work on sonic
branding for them.

127
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,399
And I think I can mention
when I was working

128
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,639
with Kellogg, they 
said, “Ooh, what’s

129
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,000
sonic branding?”

130
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,840
And I said, “You
invented this.”

131
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,920
Most people will remember
as children

132
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,160
the experience of lifting

133
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,240
a bowl to their ear.

134
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,680
And what are they
listening for?

135
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,400
Snap, crackle and pop.

136
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,040
That's sonic branding at its best,

137
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,320
and that's the original.

138
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,560
There's a lot of competition
out there,

139
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
and food companies
make their money

140
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,280
by the amount of products
we consume from them.

141
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,880
So, there's a stomach share

142
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,440
that they're fighting for

143
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,440
and there are hours in the day

144
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,440
in between breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

145
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,400
What happens between
those hours?

146
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,840
They want us to snack.

147
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,200
You wake up and this
is what you have.

148
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,400
Snack number one.

149
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
Breakfast shake,

150
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,800
ultra-processed.

151
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,120
This is heavily

152
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,920
marketed for you to
have on the go.

153
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Do not sit down.

154
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,160
Do not take time to

155
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,560
crunch through something.

156
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,040
Snack number two of the day.

157
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,760
It's empty calories,

158
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,800
energy dense, nutrient poor.

159
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,160
Midday,

160
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,160
you're starting to get
a little bit peckish,

161
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,920
and what do you have?

162
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,200
Veggie straws.

163
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,240
This is a good

164
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,440
example of a health claim

165
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,800
snacking product.

166
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,400
Whereas before we would
have had food.

167
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,680
Actual food.

168
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,480
Now we are marketed
into believing

169
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,520
that this is actually a
healthy replacement.

170
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,040
Some snacking products
have now

171
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,320
been made to be linked

172
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,880
with being physically active.

173
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,160
So, after the gym
I have a high

174
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,440
protein, low sugar bar.

175
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,240
Instead of having

176
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,560
a healthier option.

177
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,760
You finish having dinner

178
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,520
and you have these snacks

179
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,800
that are sold to you

180
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,640
as more to share,

181
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,400
where in fact you can
just finish them,

182
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,520
watching the TV by yourself.

183
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,120
I do like them.

184
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,360
I cannot stop eating them.

185
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,920
And I literally can't.

186
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,360
Oh God.

187
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,160
I think one of the biggest problems with this kind of food

188
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,360
is that so many of us

189
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,760
struggle to stop eating it.

190
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,360
Hi everyone.

191
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,760
I'm so thrilled to be here
today to speak

192
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,400
with you on my research

193
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,880
that looks at parallels

194
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,480
between addictive substances
and ultra-processed food.

195
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,000
When we look at the sorts 
of foods that trigger

196
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,600
those key diagnostic

197
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,280
indicators of addiction,

198
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,200
it's really clear
what it's not.

199
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,520
It's not minimally

200
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,320
processed foods

201
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
like fruit or vegetables

202
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,040
or beans

203
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,800
or lean meats like
chicken breast.

204
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,760
It's really processed foods.

205
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,840
It's chocolate.

206
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,920
It's ice cream.

207
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,520
It's pizza.

208
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,600
It's foods that don't
exist in nature.

209
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,000
The potency

210
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,640
and the reward power

211
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,360
of these ultra-processed foods

212
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,800
can trigger an
addictive response

213
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,160
that leads them
to consume these

214
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,760
in such a compulsive way,

215
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,200
that even if they want
to cut down,

216
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,000
even if they know
it's killing them,

217
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,360
they find they can't stop.

218
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Imagine

219
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,160
you're trying to cut down on
ultra-processed food

220
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,040
 or avoid it altogether.

221
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,080
For a start,

222
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,520
it might be the only food
you can afford,

223
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,720
and that is true
for millions of people,

224
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,120
but it's everywhere.

225
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,840
And it's engineered
and then marketed

226
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,600
by some of the smartest

227
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,040
people on Earth

228
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,280
to be irresistible.

229
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,640
So, if someone is watching this

230
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,560
and they are struggling
with their weight,

231
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,760
with diet-related disease,

232
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,720
I just want to reach out
and grab them and go,

233
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,160
“This is not your fault.

234
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,280
It is not you.

235
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,600
It is the food.”

236
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,040
[Narration]
The Food and Drink

237
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,720
Federation declined
our request

238
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,000
for an interview
but provided this

239
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,280
statement.

240
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,960
“Food and drink

241
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,720
manufacturers take 
the issue of obesity

242
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,320
and poor diets very seriously,
and we know we have a key

243
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,600
role to play in helping 
people to eat

244
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,080
balanced diets.

245
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,000
Our members continue

246
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,640
to invest hundreds
of millions of pounds

247
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,960
in creating healthier products
for shoppers.

248
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
As a result, UK shopping

249
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,160
baskets now contain

250
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,440
significantly less salt,

251
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,720
sugar and calories
than they did

252
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,000
a decade ago.

253
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,920
Companies are also working
to raise the fibre,

254
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,160
fruit and vegetable content

255
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,720
of their products.

256
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,840
It's of course up
to government

257
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,320
if they want to introduce
new taxes

258
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,600
or warning labels.

259
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,440
However, taxes

260
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,840
will push up the cost of food
and could disincentivise

261
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,600
ongoing investment
in healthier products.

262
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,039
We think there are more
effective ways to encourage

263
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,759
positive dietary change.

264
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,640
On labelling,

265
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,960
we believe the UK's traffic

266
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,280
light system is a more positive

267
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,880
way of nudging
consumers towards

268
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,320
healthier choices
than warning

269
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,160
labels, where global evidence

270
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,440
suggests the longer
term impact

271
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,720
is limited.

272
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,680
However, we would support
a labelling review,

273
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,720
including to test whether
consistent positive

274
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,920
labelling on all healthier

275
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,320
products would help consumers.

276
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,960
The government's
Scientific Advisory

277
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,200
Committee on Nutrition

278
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,440
has said there's insufficient scientific evidence

279
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,000
on the concept of ‘ultra-processed foods’ for it

280
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,440
to be used for
dietary guidance

281
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,760
or policy making, and that 
further research is needed.

282
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,920
If research comes to light,

283
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,760
that processing is a cause
for concern,

284
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,200
the food industry will
act quickly

285
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,680
to change their ingredients
or processes.”
